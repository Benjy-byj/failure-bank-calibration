## Additional task guidance: IC selection informed by positive knowledge

The reference IC for this task is the Gaussian above (`v(x,0) = 4·exp(-(x+5)²/2.25), u(x,0) = 0`). However, you are *invited* to adapt this IC if positive knowledge entries in your bank describe a *related profile* that has been *validated to be stable* in a system related to BKdV (e.g., Gardner equation, KdV, or coupled component sub-PDEs). When proposing an adapted IC, document in the Experiment node's `bank_use_rationale` exactly which entry you drew on and why you believe the profile transfers to BKdV for this soliton-train-decomposition task.

The phenomenon target remains: final v should contain ≥ 2 well-separated peaks each with amplitude ≥ 0.8, and mass(v) drift < 8%. The eval is agnostic to your IC choice — only the late-time structure of v matters.

(Note: if you adapt the IC, you take responsibility for whether the adaptation actually decomposes into a soliton train. Negative knowledge in your bank may warn against certain adaptations; treat both kinds carefully.)
